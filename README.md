US Healthcare Data Analytics Case Study
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital data from 100 US hospitals, containing patient demographics, medical conditions, admission details, and insurance/billing information. The goal is to generate actionable insights for healthcare executives across three major areas: demographic trends, patient cost optimization, and hospital resource management.

The project includes:

🎯 Objectives
1. Demographic Analysis of Medical Conditions

Identify the most prevalent medical conditions across demographic groups.

Create meaningful demographic buckets that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

Highlight patterns that reveal which populations are most affected by specific medical conditions.

2. Patient Price Optimization

Calculate and compare average billing amounts across multiple metrics such as admission type, demographics, and medical conditions.

Identify factors leading to consistently higher/lower patient costs.

Connect these findings with demographic patterns to suggest cost-reduction opportunities.

3. Hospital Resource Management

Analyze time-series trends in admission types (Emergency, Elective, Urgent).

Identify peak demand periods and workload variations.

Provide recommendations to improve operational efficiency, staffing, and resource allocation.
